She would take the world off my shoulders if it was ever hard to move,
She would turn the rain to a rainbow when I was living in the blue,
Why then if she is so perfect do I still wish that it was you,
Perfect don't mean that it's working So what can I do,
When you're out of sight In my mind,
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us,
And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was,
Said I'm fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us,
Tell me he savors your glory Does he laugh the way I did,
Is this a part of your story? One that I had never lived, 
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse,
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly And find me again,
When you're out of sight In my mind,
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us,
And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was,
Said I am fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms,
Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us, 
Because sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us,
And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was,
Said I'm fine and said I moved on I am only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us,
